I sure do love my daily does of breaking TOS of file hosting services, this it attempt two at this cause i was a dumbass the first time i tried it, cause i used drime where you would need to verify your email address everytime you logged in again, which is bad.

To run/install this thing do these command in the same directory as the requirments.txt and also the python file if you want

pip install uv

uv pip install -r requirments.txt --system

then just run the script, input whatever it asks you to input and then just run it, when trying to look at the browsers so turning headless of it does not put the browsers correctly but i cant be bothered to fix it, so go do it yourself or live with using it weird or just use it headless.

All the accounts will be saved in accounts.txt in the same directory, and then you can just go on filen.io login and upload and share files if you need to so badly. Each account is 20GB each i think, if you have files bigger than that you just split them up, google it, ask chatgpt or whatever on how to do it.
